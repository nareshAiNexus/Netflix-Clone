# Netflix-Clone
 In this project, I built a Netflix clone using React and Firebase, enhancing my skills in dynamic web development. I learned to implement user authentication, manage state, and use Firestore for real-time data. This experience improved my ability to create responsive designs, optimize performance, and effectively utilize third-party APIs.
